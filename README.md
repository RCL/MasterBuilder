# Master Builder
---

**This application is still in it's very initial stages**

Master Builder is an attempt at a build coordinator in tandem with DistCC. Ideally, each build machine and user machine will run Citizen Builder which will keep the Master Builder informed of it's status. Master Builder will then in turn provide Citizen's with host and core on which DistCC can compile it's workload.
